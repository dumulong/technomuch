# Shoes

Hiking boots vs trail runners. Trail runners are light and embrace the rocks and give you a better feel (supple) but more hard on feet. Hiking boots offers a better protection for your ankles. I bring both but never user boots. A sole with good grip is very important.

# Socks
2 pairs, one in the backpack for quick exchange. Avoid cotton. Merino wool blend is a good choice (low friction, wicking, quick dry and no smell)
Darn Tough is a good brand but a bit expensive ($25).  I normally just get some unknown brand from Academy for cheaper.


# Pants
Protect from cold but loose for movement.  There is some rock scrambling on top of 14ers (hands and feet parts)

# Underwear
Avoid cotton. Consider synthetic sport boxer briefs: water wicking, protects inner thighs...

# Core/layering
3 layers system: Synthetic base layer to wick away sweat. Middle layer: puffy, air pockets to isolate. Finally, wind breaker (with hood and rain proof) to keep middle layerâ€™s warmth.

# Gloves
Need a good pair for the 14ers.

# Head
Beanie for the 14ers.
Baseball cap, rag.

# Hiking poles
Optional, easier for legs while coming down.

# Head lamp/flashlights
Need it for early morning start (14ers) and when running out of time in the evening, although near full moon expected.

# Food
Need a boost for 14ers (carbs/salt): Trail mix with some sugar/dry fruits.

# Water
Need a 2L container at least.  May need extra liter in a side container for 14ers.

# Backpack
Big enough to fit beanie, gloves, mid layer, outer layer, food and water. I have a 22 liters and struggling a bit.

# Other things (optional):
Sun tan lotion
Sunglasses
Tylenol
Athletic tape/gauze
Salt/electrolyte
Pocket knife
String/rope
Tissues (my nose! or TP in case)
Small Purell bottle (for the TP eventuality)
Small trash bags (for the TP eventuality)
