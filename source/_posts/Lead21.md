This is a list of things that I've learned over the years.  Nothing is really important (except for good sole with good grip). I follow these ideas to make my trip a bit nicer but, in the end, please do what you want and enjoy the scenery. We will find a way to have a blast!


## Shoes

Hiking boots vs trail runners. Trail runners are lighter and embrace the rocks better (supple). You will get a better feel for the terrain but it's harder on feet. Hiking boots offers a better protection for your ankles (and all around protection).<br>
I normally bring both because I have them but now, I only use my trail runners.<br>
Anyhow, a sole with good grip is the only important thing.<br>

__Special note:__
Make sure that you have enough room for your toes. Your feet __will swell__ and going downhill for 4-5 hours straight may cause painful blue toe nails.

## Socks
2 pairs recommended : wear one and keep one in the backpack for quick exchange.<br>
Avoid cotton. Merino wool blend is a good choice (low friction, wicking, quick dry and no smell).<br>
Darn Tough is a good brand but a bit expensive ($25).<br>
I normally just get some unknown brand from Academy for cheaper.


## Pants
Protect from cold but loose for movement.<br>
__Special note:__ There is some rock scrambling on top of 14ers (hands and feet parts).

## Underwear
Avoid cotton. Consider synthetic sport boxer briefs: water wicking, protects inner thighs...

## Core/layering
3 layers system: Synthetic base layer to wick away sweat. Middle layer: puffy, air pockets to isolate. Finally, wind breaker (with hood and rain proof) to keep middle layerâ€™s warmth.

## Gloves
Need a good pair for the 14ers.

## Head
Beanie for the 14ers.
Baseball cap, rag.

## Hiking poles
Optional, easier for legs while coming down (about %10-20 relief on the legs).

## Head lamp/flashlights
Need it for early morning start (14ers) and when running out of time in the evening, although near full moon expected this year.

## Food
Need a boost for 14ers (carbs/salt): Trail mix with some salted nuts/sweet chocolate/dry fruits.<br>
If we are not getting a early start (i.e. not doing a 14ers), we stop by the coffee shop and get some pastries to go.

## Water
Need a 2L container at least.  May need extra liter in a side container for 14ers.<br>

## Backpack
Big enough to fit beanie, gloves, mid layer, outer layer, food and water. I have a 22 liters and struggling a bit.

## Other things (optional):
Sun tan lotion<br>
Sunglasses<br>
Tylenol<br>
Athletic tape/gauze<br>
Salt/electrolyte<br>
Pocket knife<br>
String/rope<br>
Tissues (my nose goes wild! also, can serve as TP)<br>
Small Purell bottle (for the TP eventuality)<br>
Small trash bags (for the TP eventuality)<br>
